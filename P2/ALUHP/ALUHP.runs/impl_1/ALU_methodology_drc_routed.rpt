2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) salidas[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (salidas[0]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) salidas[1] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (salidas[1]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#3 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) salidas[2] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (salidas[2]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#4 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) salidas[3] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (salidas[3]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
